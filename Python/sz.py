""" StupidZip
    
    This is a utility script to help you compress and uncompress files,
    without having to memorize all of the annoying flags and options
    in those tools.

    This is the reference implementation of StupidZip.
    All future versions must conform to the behaivor in this script.
    The support for compression utiltities, commandline/flag behavior,
    and how it handles errors all must match this script.
    
    This script is designed for POSIX-style commandlines.
    
    This script MUST conform to both the Python v2.x and v3.x standards,
    to support as many users as possible.
