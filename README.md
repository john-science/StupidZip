## The Entire Specification

Why are we still memorizing tar flags?

![XKCD on tar](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tar.png)

Can't we just have one tool that looks at your file name and does the thing that you obviously want to do?  It is not that complicated.

Look, here is the functionality we want.  Just uncompress the compressed:

    $ sz whatever.tar.gz        # runs: tar xzf whatever.tar.gz
    $ sz whatever.tar           # runs: tar xf whatever.tar
    $ sz whatever.gz            # runs: gunzip whatever.gz
    $ sz whatever.zip           # runs: unzip whatever.zip
    $ sz whatever.bz2           # runs: bzip2 -d whatever.bz2
    $ sz whatever.tar.bz2       # runs: tar xjf whatever.tar.bz2
    $ sz whatever.tar.xz        # runs: tar xJf whatever.tar.xz

And tar-gzip the uncompressed:

    $ sz whatever               # runs: tar zcf whatever.tar.gz whatever

And if you pass a big list of files (or directories) it does the correct thing for each of them.


#### Can we have a verbose flag?

Fine. If you give this program a `-v` flag it will run whatever you are doing in verbose mode; assuming that is possible.

But that is the **ONLY** flag this program will ever have.  We are not going to create more things to memorize.


#### What if there are errors?

Any errors will be passed through, exactly as-is, to standard-out.  This includes the error that one of the necessary tools (`tar`, `gzip`, etc) are not installed.


## The "Problem"

BUT!  AH HA!  BUT!  You just thought of this exceptional case where the above would totally fail.

> Congratulations. I don't care.

This program will not be bullet proof.  It will not have the full power of all those other tools. For that you would need: all those other tools.  This is only meant to be a helpful time-saver for the typical use-case of 99.9% of Linux users.


## The Implementation

This tool should work for any POSIX-style commandline interface.

At first, this will be a single Python script. That will serve as a feature reference. Over time, versions will be added in other languages so that users can hack the program in the language of their choice.
